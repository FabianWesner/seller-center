## About the Project

This repository hosts an Open-Source Seller Center (OSSC) for shop owners, who want to turn their existing online shop into a marketplace. 

A Seller Center is an application that runs side-by-side to the online shop and is integrated via API. It enables sellers to manage products, inventory, and pricing while processing orders from integrated online shops. If you've sold on platforms like Amazon or eBay, you're already familiar with the concept.

Despite being essential for marketplaces, most e-commerce platforms lack this functionality, forcing shop operators to rely on costly commercial solutions. Surprisingly, a robust open-source alternative has been missing from the market.

This project aims to fill that gap. Built in public and free to use, it will be developed transparently from initial implementation to the first release. I'll regularly document progress, sharing insights, challenges, and solutions to provide a clear view of the development process.
